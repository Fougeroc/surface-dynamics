.. current developments

v0.4.7
====================

**Changed:**

* Enumeration of fat graphs up to isomorphism (FatGraphs class).

**Fixed:**

* Make fat graph exhaustive generation works in all cases



v0.4.6
======

**Fixed:**

* Wrong computation of the stratum component for generalized permutation associated
  to quadratic differentials

* Fixed SEGFAULT in integral iet statistics

* problematic utf-8 encoding in README.rst that used to break the setup.py script

* undeclared utf-8 encoding in some Python files

**Changed:**

* Masur-Veech volume contribution of individual cylinder diagrams as multiple
  zeta values

* Density function for Rauzy induction

* Flip sequence for Rauzy induction. It is now possible to construct
  pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism without generating the Rauzy diagrams.

* Masur polygon (as a triangulated sage-flatsurf surface)

* Implementation of regular covers for faster computation of isotypical
  components

* conversion to and from pyintervalxt

v0.4.5
======

**Fixed:**

* fix .factor() for multivariate generating series

**Changed:**

* Topological recursion (Kontsevich and Masur-Veech volumes)

* up_to_symmetry option for cylinder diagrams

* more flexible statistics for interval exchange transformations

* fix orientation cover for Q(-1^4)

* erase_marked_points for interval exchange transformations

* generators for square tiled surfaces with cylinders of height one
