Welcome to surface_dynamic's documentation!
===========================================

Installation
------------

In order to install the surface_dynamic package in `SageMath <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_
you need to run the following command in a console::

    $ sage -pip install surface_dynamics

You might want to provide the option ``--user`` to this command in order to install
surface dynamics in your home directory and keep intact your SageMath installation.

In case you use the sagemath package in a Debian or Ubuntu system you need to perform
a two step installation::

    $ source /usr/share/sagemath/bin/sage-env
    $ sage -pip install surface_dynamics --user
