- affine group of an origami

- representation of the affine group in homology. Together with
nice examples
 -> Wollmilchsau
 -> other cyclic covers

- sparse permutation to encode origamis

- include Charles Fougeron code about Lyapunov exponents

- generic flat and translation surfaces (built from a triangulation or more
  generally a decomposition into convex polygons).
   - nice plot of trajectory
   - billiards (and parking garage) unfolding
   - unfolding of conical surfaces
  (look also at Ronen Mukamel code)

- Delaunay Lp-triangulations (for flat surfaces)

- SL(2,R) orbit closures (using Delaunay L-infinity triangulation)
   - volume computation (needs non-trivial integration)

- include Alex Eskin code about computing cylinder decomposition
  (it might actually be good to reimplement it using Ferenczi generalized diagonal changes)

- include Michael Boshernitzan algorithm to check for minimality

- interface with Snappy (i.e. mapping torus)

- implement an algorithm to enumerate pseudo-Anosov in a fixed stratum ordered by length

- interval exchanges in the non-orientable case
    - minimal component of the Rauzy diagram
    - orientation cover

- separate topological surfaces

- more on geometry of surfaces (uniformization, quasi-conformal mappings, etc)
